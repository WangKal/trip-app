"Describe the front-end design of a public participation app that enables citizens to engage with governance, laws, policies, and development projects at different levels (national, county, ward, etc.). The backend is built with Laravel (PHP), and sentiment analysis is handled using Python. The front end should be designed using React and Vue, focusing on a modern, intuitive, and responsive user interface.
